 ## Description
 
 To learn MongoDB and demonstrate my knowledge.
 
 This database will be the backend of an application to help people connect.
 I learned that routes are harder to match up than I had previously thought.
 
 My VScode does not like to play nicely with insomnia on my computer. I was unable to test my code because of this.     
 I would like to be able to test it appropriatley and have a video showing how it works.

## Usage
To use the project you will need node.js, express, mongoose and the other node packages in the packages.json.
## Credits
I had help from my TA's, and a tutor.
